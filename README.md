I am a programmer and a professional in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, with a strong background in logical thinking, problem-solving, and the creation of technology-driven solutions. Throughout my education and experience, I have worked on projects that combine theory and practice, allowing me to strengthen skills such as analysis, idea structuring, and the implementation of functional systems.

I’m deeply interested in understanding how things work — from algorithm design to the real-world impact a technological solution can have. I enjoy the process of continuous learning, collaborative work, and the challenge of turning ideas into useful products. I believe that code is not only a way to build, but also a way to think and communicate.

## 🎮🧠📚 Beyond the Code

I'm passionate about video games not just as entertainment, but as spaces for strategy, creativity, and storytelling.  
I find inspiration in Stoic philosophy, which helps me stay focused, disciplined, and calm in the face of challenges.  
I also enjoy reading, especially topics that expand my perspective and fuel my curiosity.  
And yes, I love fashion it's a form of expression where design, detail, and attitude come together, just like in a well-crafted piece of software.  
Everything I am, I bring into everything I build.
